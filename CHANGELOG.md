- CHANGE:
    * The dhall language for replica has changed and is now hosted in its own project.
      If you have existing `dhall` tests that you don't want to change, you can use this
      url as an entry point for replica:
      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReplicaTest/REPLica/v0.4.0/dhall/replica.dhall

- NEW:
    * `replica new` to create tests file templates
    * `suite` to organise your test by suites
    * test name with spaces are officially supported
    * execution time of each test is tracked
- FIX:
    * `replica help` mentions `version`
    * skipped tests are displayed
