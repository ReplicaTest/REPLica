# REPLica

**WIP: file format and command line usage may (often) change.**

Golden tests for Commnd Line interfaces.

## Purpose

Replica aims at managing tests suites composed of command line interfaces calls.

It compares the output of the command line to a "golden value": a stored value of the expected
outcome of the command line call.
If you want a more detailled introduction to golden testing, here is a [nice introduction][golden].

The idea comes from the way tests are implemented in [idris2][idris tests].
